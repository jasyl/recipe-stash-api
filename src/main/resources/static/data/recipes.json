    "instructions" : "Pickle the jalapeños: In a medium saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, yuzu juice, and garlic over high. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and add the jalapeños. Cool, then cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.\n\nMake the miso sauce: Place the mirin in a small saucepan over high. As it starts boiling, set it on fire using a lighter, taking care not to burn yourself. Whisk in the misos and set aside.\n\nMake the scallion oil: Place all of the ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the scallions are golden, 35 to 40 minutes. Strain, discarding the solids, and set aside until ready to use.\n\nMake the spiced beef: Combine all of the ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.\n\nMake the chopped cheese: Heat 2-inches oil in a large saucepan until a deep-fry thermometer reads 325°F. Toss the rice cakes with the cornstarch, then fry until puffed, but not golden, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\nHeat 3 tablespoons oil in a wok over high. Add the beef and cook until brown, 2 minutes. Add the rice cakes and 2 tablespoons of the miso sauce, tossing to combine for 1 minute. Add the labneh, American cheese, and ⅓ cup water and toss until the cheese has melted. Toss in a few of the pickled jalapenos and the scallions. Transfer to a bowl and grate the parmesan over the top. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and fried shallots."

    "instructions": "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425°. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Trim root ends from 8 scallions. Thinly slice crosswise (not on a diagonal); set aside.\n\nMelt 2 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter by whatever method is easiest for you; set aside. Whisk 2½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, 1¾ tsp. baking powder, ½ tsp. baking soda, 1¼ tsp. sugar, and 2½ cups (313 g) all-purpose flour in a large bowl to combine.\n\nCut remaining 10 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter into ½” pieces. Add to dry ingredients and toss to coat. Using your hands, work butter into dry ingredients, smashing it between your fingers and flattening it between your palm until there are lots of thin shards and pea-size bits. Add reserved scallions and toss to evenly distribute.\n\nCreate a well in the center of mixture and add 1¼ cups sour cream to the center. Using a fork and working in circles, mix until large shaggy clumps form. If your bowl is wide enough, fold dough over itself a couple of times inside it until it comes together.\n\nTurn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice until it comes together; flour your hands if needed. If there are any loose bits, add them to center of dough and knead once more to incorporate.\n\nPat dough into an 8x4” rectangle about 1” thick.\n\nWorking from a short side, fold dough in thirds as you would a letter. It doesn’t need to overlap perfectly. Pat dough into another 8x4” rectangle, then fold dough in thirds like a letter one more time. (You'll have done the folding procedure two times total.) Pat dough back into an 8x4” rectangle and straighten up with your hands and/or your bench scraper. (This folding method is what will create those nice flaky layers in your final biscuits.)\n\nCut rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into 4 squares for a total of 8 biscuits.\n\nTransfer biscuits to prepared baking sheet. Brush tops gently with melted butter; sprinkle with flaky sea salt.\n\nBake biscuits until golden brown, 18–22 minutes. Serve warm with sour cream (or more butter!) for slathering."
